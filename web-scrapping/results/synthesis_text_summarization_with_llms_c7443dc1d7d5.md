# Synthesis of Text Summarization Using GPT-3.5 Turbo and Streamlit
## Introduction
The article provides a comprehensive guide on creating a text summarizer using GPT-3.5 Turbo, a state-of-the-art language model, and Streamlit, a tool for building web applications. It emphasizes the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 Turbo in understanding and generating human-like text. The article is aimed at demonstrating the process of integrating OpenAI's API with a Python backend and Streamlit to build a functional text summarization application.
## Preparatory Steps
### Registration and API Key Generation
- To utilize OpenAI's API, one must register on the OpenAI developer platform and generate an API key, which should be securely saved as OpenAI does not retain a copy of the key.
### Installation of Dependencies
- The project requires the installation of two primary dependencies: OpenAI and Streamlit, which can be installed using the Python package manager pip.
## Building the Text Summarizer
### Code Overview
- The author provides Python code snippets that interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model using the ChatCompletion API. This API facilitates a conversational interface where prompts are passed, and the model returns the desired summarization output.
### Hyperparameters Explanation
- The `messages` hyperparameter is crucial, containing two dictionary objects. The first dictionary sets the model to act as a text summarizer, while the second dictionary is where the actual text to be summarized is passed.
- Additional variables such as `person_type` and `prompt` are highlighted. `person_type` allows control over the style of the summary, and `prompt` is the variable for the input text.
## Streamlit Web Application Development
### Code Integration and Execution
- All Python code is saved in a file named `summarize.py`. The application is initiated using the Streamlit command `streamlit run summarize.py` in the command prompt, which opens the application in a web browser.
### Application Usage
- Users can input text into the web application and click the `Summarize` button to obtain a summary. The application also allows users to experiment with hyperparameters and observe how changes affect the output.
### Exploring the `who are you?` Parameter
- The application includes a feature to tailor responses based on the user's background, such as "Second-Grader" or "University Student," demonstrating the model's ability to adjust explanations to the user's level of understanding.
## Conclusion and Resources
The article concludes by highlighting the potential of Generative AI to solve industry problems and provides a practical example through the text summarization application. It underscores the ease of using OpenAI's APIs with Python and Streamlit to create such applications.
