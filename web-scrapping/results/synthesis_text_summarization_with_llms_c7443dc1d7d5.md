## Introduction
The article by Pritam Paul provides an overview of using Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 turbo, for the task of text summarization. It outlines the process of creating a text summarization application using the OpenAI API, Python, and Streamlit.
## Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs like GPT-4, LaMDA, and BLOOM have been trained on extensive text datasets, enabling them to generate human-like responses. The focus of this article is on GPT-3.5 turbo, which is noted for its improved contextual accuracy in text generation.
## Prerequisites
Before starting, the author notes the necessity of having an API key from the OpenAI developer platform. The importance of securely saving the API key is emphasized, as OpenAI does not display it after creation, and losing it requires generating a new one.
## Building the Text Summarizer
The author used Python for backend development and Streamlit for creating the web application interface. Streamlit is highlighted for its ease of use, particularly for beginners. The dependencies for the project are OpenAI and Streamlit, which can be installed via pip commands:
- `pip install openai`
- `pip install streamlit`
## Implementation Details
The article provides a Python code snippet to interact with the GPT-3.5 turbo model using the ChatCompletion API. This API allows for a conversational interface where prompts are passed to receive summarization outputs. The author explains the use of hyperparameters within the code, particularly the `messages` hyperparameter, which includes dictionaries for setting the model and passing the text to be summarized.
## Web Application Development
The Python code for the application is saved in a file named `summarize.py`. To launch the application, the command `streamlit run summarize.py` is executed in the command prompt, which opens the application in the default web browser. The application allows users to input text and receive a summary upon pressing the 'Summarize' button.
## Experimentation with Hyperparameters
The author encourages experimenting with hyperparameters to observe how they affect the output. An interesting parameter to test is the `who are you?` option, which alters the response style based on the selected persona, such as a second-grader or a professional data scientist.
## Conclusion and Resources
The rise of Generative AI presents opportunities to address industry challenges more efficiently. This article has demonstrated the use of OpenAI's APIs to create a text summarization tool. For the complete code, the author refers readers to the GitHub repository.
