#### Article Information
- **Title**: Webinar Recap: Boost Your LLM with Private Data Using LlamaIndex
- **Author**: Zilliz
- **Date**: Nov 17, 2023
- **Reading Time**: 6 min read
#### Introduction
The article discusses the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and introduces LlamaIndex, a tool designed to augment LLMs with private data. The webinar, featuring Jerry Liu and Frank Liu from LlamaIndex and Zilliz respectively, covered methods to enhance LLMs, the functionality of LlamaIndex, its integration with Milvus, and various use cases. The article also addresses audience questions from the webinar.
#### Enhancing LLMs with Private Data
- **Fine-tuning and in-context learning**: Jerry Liu discussed two primary methods to enhance LLMs with private data:
  - **Fine-tuning**: Retraining the network with private data, which can be costly and sometimes ineffective.
  - **In-context learning**: Pairing a pre-trained model with external knowledge and a retrieval model to add context to the input prompt, which presents its own set of challenges.
#### What is LlamaIndex?
- **LlamaIndex**: An open-source toolkit that serves as a centralized data management and query interface for LLM applications. It consists of:
  - Data connectors for ingesting data from various sources.
  - Data indices for structuring data for different use cases.
  - A query interface for inputting prompts and receiving knowledge-augmented output.
#### LlamaIndex’s Vector Store Index
- **Vector Store Index**: A mode of retrieval and synthesis that pairs a vector store with a language model. It involves:
  - Ingesting documents and splitting them into text nodes.
  - Storing nodes in the vector store with an embedding for each node.
  - Using a query embedding to find the top-k most similar nodes for response synthesis.
#### Integration of Milvus and LlamaIndex
- **Milvus**: An open-source vector database capable of handling large datasets.
- **Integration**: Simplifies the setup process by inputting parameters, wrapping them in storage context, and using them in the vector store index.
- **Zilliz Cloud**: Offers a fully-managed, cloud-native service for Milvus, with integration available for LlamaIndex.
#### LlamaIndex Use Cases
- The webinar highlighted several use cases for LlamaIndex, including:
  - Semantic search
  - Summarization
  - Text to SQL
  - Synthesis over heterogeneous data
  - Compare/contrast queries
  - Multi-step queries
  - Exploiting temporal relationships
  - Recency filtering / outdated nodes
#### Q&A Highlights
- **OpenAI’s plugins**: LlamaIndex can function as a plugin and supports integration with services implementing the `chatgpt-retrieval-plugin`.
- **Performance and latency**: Trade-offs include context amount, chunk size, and the inherent delay in chained LLM calls.
- **Data security**: Private data security depends on the API service used, with PII modules added to LlamaIndex for enhanced security.
- **Approaches to data handling**: Leveraging a vector database like Milvus before LlamaIndex or using LlamaIndex's native integrations.
- **Analyzing local documents**: Recommendations for analyzing local PDFs and PowerPoints without using OpenAI or LlamaIndex.
#### Conclusion
The webinar provided insights into how LlamaIndex can be used to enhance LLMs with private data, its integration with Milvus, and various use cases. The Q&A session addressed important questions about the tool's capabilities, performance, and security concerns.
