#### Main Content
The article delves into the utilization of Recursive or Iterative Retrieval in the development of self-learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These systems are designed to enhance their learning over time and to conduct in-depth explorations of unstructured data autonomously or under directed guidance. Anthony Alcaraz, CAIO at Fribl, describes recursive retrieval as a process where a query is applied across smaller corpus segments, with intermediate results being recursively fed into subsequent steps and aggregated to combine the outputs. This process involves a Language Model (LLM) agent that continuously scans for relevant sentences and paragraphs, retrieves them, then combines them to examine the answer, including retrieving information related to any second-order concepts or information hinted at in the initial answer.
The article highlights the significant implications of Recursive or Iterative Retrieval, including providing consistent and exhaustive retrieval of core ideas, enabling multi-hop retrieval across multiple documents, and tying an increase in unstructured data input to a tangible increase in LLM accuracy. It discusses the creation of knowledge graphs iteratively and 'just-in-time' for specific questions, acting as a second brain within a RAG pipeline.
The approaches to recursive retrieval are categorized into three types:
1. **Page-Based Recursive Retrieval:** This approach involves the LLM tracking and diving deeper into subsequent pages referenced in the initial information. It is particularly useful for navigating highly technical manuals in manufacturing industries, where the agent follows a deterministic pathway driven by page references.
2. **Information-Centric Recursive Retrieval:** This method focuses on retrieving information relevant to a fixed seed node or concept, allowing the LLM to discover key relationships and track them. The iterative knowledge graph expands with each chapter added, becoming directionally smarter over time in the defined area of focus.
3. **Concept-Centric Recursive Retrieval:** In this approach, the retrieval exercise focuses on retrieving concepts, where top-level nodes and n+2 nodes are decided by the LLM based on their potential relevance to the question. This method involves probing each branch of the node to discover if it leads closer to the correct answer, with challenges including controlling the LLM to ensure relevance and understanding when the right answer is reached.
The article also discusses the technical difficulties associated with Concept-Centric Recursive Retrieval, such as controlling the LLM to ensure relevance and understanding when the right answer is reached. Solutions include good prompting, multi-agent construction, and pre-processing work to map all relevant concepts in a contextual dictionary.
#### Conclusion
The article by Chia Jeng Yang provides an insightful exploration into the advanced use of Recursive or Iterative Retrieval in RAG systems, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the ability of these systems to learn and explore unstructured data over time. By categorizing the approaches into Page-Based, Information-Centric, and Concept-Centric Recursive Retrieval, the article sheds light on the versatility and challenges of implementing these methods in practical applications.
