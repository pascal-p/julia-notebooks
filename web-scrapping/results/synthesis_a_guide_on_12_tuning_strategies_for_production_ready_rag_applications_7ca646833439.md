## Introduction
The article by Leonie Monigatti, published in Towards Data Science, delves into the experimental nature of Data Science and the importance of hyperparameter tuning in Machine Learning (ML) projects, specifically focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It emphasizes the "No Free Lunch Theorem," which posits the absence of a universally superior algorithm for all problems, leading to the necessity of experiment tracking systems for hyperparameter optimization.
## RAG Pipeline: Ingestion and Inferencing Stages
### Ingestion Stage
The ingestion stage is likened to data cleaning and preprocessing in ML, involving steps to prepare for building a RAG pipeline. The article discusses strategies to enhance the relevance of retrieved contexts during the inferencing stage, highlighting the significance of data quality and the application of various techniques and hyperparameters.
#### Chunking Documents
Chunking is presented as a critical step, with the choice of chunking technique and the length of chunks (chunk_size) being pivotal based on the use case. The concept of a "rolling window" (overlap) between chunks is introduced to provide additional context.
#### Embedding Models
The quality of embeddings is underscored as a determinant of retrieval results. The article references the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard for alternative models and suggests fine-tuning embedding models to the specific use case, citing a potential 5â€“10% performance increase according to LlamaIndex research.
#### Vector Databases and Metadata
The storage of vector embeddings in vector databases with metadata is discussed for post-processing search results, such as metadata filtering. The possibility of using multiple indexes for different document types is mentioned, along with the concept of native multi-tenancy.
#### Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search
ANN search is contrasted with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search, with various ANN algorithms like Facebook Faiss, Spotify Annoy, Google ScaNN, and HNSWLIB being options for experimentation. The article notes that parameters for these algorithms are typically tuned by research teams rather than RAG system developers.
### Inferencing Stage: Retrieval and Generation
#### Retrieval Component
The retrieval component is described as more impactful than the generative component. Strategies to improve retrieval include query transformations, retrieval parameters, advanced retrieval strategies, and re-ranking models. The article discusses the balance between semantic and keyword-based search, the number of search results to retrieve, and the importance of setting similarity measures according to the embedding model used.
#### Generation Component
The generative component, involving a Language Model (LLM), is briefly touched upon. Strategies include fine-tuning the LLM, prompt engineering, and the use of few-shot examples. The article warns of the "Lost in the Middle" effect, where relevant context may be overlooked by the LLM if not positioned effectively.
