### Article Analysis: Advanced RAG Implementation on Custom Data Using Hybrid Search, Embed Caching And Mistral-AI
#### Introduction
The article titled "Advanced RAG Implementation on Custom Data Using Hybrid Search, Embed Caching And Mistral-AI" was authored by Plaban Nayak and published on AI Planet on October 8, 2023. The article provides a comprehensive guide on implementing an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, leveraging concepts such as caching embeddings, hybrid vector search, and in-memory caching. The implementation utilizes various technologies including BAAI general embedding for the embedder, FAISS Vectorstore for retrieval, and the Mistral-7B-Instruct GPTQ model for generation, with the infrastructure supported by Google Colab and an A100 GPU. The data used in this implementation consists of financial documents.
#### What is RAG?
RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a methodology that combines information retrieval with natural language generation to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text. It is particularly useful for complex language tasks such as question-answering, summarization, and text completion. The goal of RAG is to improve the generation process by incorporating relevant information from retrieval, thereby producing more accurate, coherent, and informative content.
#### Advanced RAG Concepts Implemented
The article discusses the implementation of advanced RAG concepts, which include:
- **Caching Embeddings**: Embeddings are stored or temporarily cached to avoid recomputation. This is achieved using a `CacheBackedEmbeddings` wrapper around an embedder that caches embeddings in a key-value store. The text is hashed and used as the key in the cache. The implementation uses the local file system for storing embeddings and FAISS vector store for retrieval.
- **Hybrid Vector Search**: This is a combination of keyword search (using the BM25 algorithm) and vector search (using embeddings and FAISS for semantic search). The `EnsembleRetriever` combines the results of both retrievers and reranks them using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion algorithm.
- **InMemoryCaching**: Caching occurs for each user query and response generated, provided the user query does not match an already requested query.
#### Implementation Stack
The implementation stack includes:
- Embedder: BAAI general embedding
- Retrieval: FAISS Vectorstore
- Generation: Mistral-7B-Instruct GPTQ model
- Infrastructure: Google Colab, A100 GPU
- Data: Financial Documents
#### Implementation Details
The implementation details are outlined step by step, starting with the installation of required packages and importing necessary Python packages. The process includes data parsing and loading using LangChain, creating manageable pieces of text with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, creating a vector store with `CacheBackedEmbeddings`, and setting up a sparse embedding with `BM25Retriever`.
#### Retrieval and Generation
The retrieval of passages similar to the query is demonstrated, followed by the setup of the `EnsembleRetriever` for hybrid search. The quantized GPTQ model is downloaded and a pipeline is created for text generation. The LLM is initialized using the quantized GPTQ model, and caching is set up with `InMemoryCache`.
#### Prompt Template and Retrieval Chain
A prompt template is formulated to guide the generation of responses by the LLM. The retrieval chain is set up without hybrid search initially, and then with hybrid search, demonstrating the process of handling user queries and generating responses.
#### Conclusion
The article concludes by highlighting the effectiveness of hybrid search using `EnsembleRetriever` in providing better context to the generative AI model, resulting in improved responses. Additionally, caching responses and query embeddings significantly reduces inference time and computational costs.
