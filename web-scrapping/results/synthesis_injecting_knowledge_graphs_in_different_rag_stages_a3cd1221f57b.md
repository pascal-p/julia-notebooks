#### Main Content
The article by Chia Jeng Yang, published in Enterprise RAG on January 5, 2024, delves into the application of knowledge graphs (KG) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The focus is on identifying the types of problems that can arise in a RAG pipeline and how the integration of knowledge graphs at various stages can address these issues. The author aims to demonstrate the practical enhancement of a RAG pipeline through knowledge graphs, detailing the improvements in answers and queries at each stage.
The author emphasizes that the use of graph technology in RAG systems is not merely as a general structured data store but as a means to strategically inject human reasoning into the system. The article provides a non-technical introduction and a technical deep-dive for readers to understand complex RAG and multi-hop data retrieval.
The article outlines the terminology for the steps in the KG-enabled RAG process, referencing an image that illustrates the stages. These stages are then mapped onto another image within the article, aligning the numbered stages in the RAG process and adding a few more. The techniques discussed include Chunk Augmentation, Chunk Extraction Rules, Recursive Knowledge Graph Queries, Response Augmentation, Response Control, and Chunk Access Controls, which correspond to stages 1 to 6.
A practical example from the medical field is used to deconstruct the application of these techniques. The example question is: "What is the latest research in Alzheimerâ€™s disease treatment?" The article suggests that not every RAG system may need all the steps outlined, but these techniques can be beneficial for specific use-cases, especially in complex RAG systems.
The article also discusses the advantages of using a knowledge graph over a vector database for query augmentation, highlighting the ability of knowledge graphs to enforce consistent retrieval for key topics and concepts with known relationships. The company WhyHow.AI is mentioned as an entity working on simplifying knowledge graph creation and management within RAG pipelines.
The potential market growth for knowledge graphs is discussed, with the expectation that the need for small ontologies will grow exponentially. This could lead to a fragmented market dynamic between ontology buyers and sellers.
Personalization is framed as the control of information flow between the user and the vector database, and knowledge graphs are posited as a means to store a broader collection of user traits for personalization efforts. The article suggests that knowledge graphs, being external to Large Language Models (LLMs), can be more easily extracted and used in a modular fashion, potentially serving as digital twins for user preferences that can be ported between models.
WhyHow.AI's focus on assisting developers in integrating knowledge graphs into RAG pipelines is highlighted, and the article concludes with an invitation for developers to contact the team at WhyHow.AI.

#### Conclusion
The article provides a comprehensive overview of how knowledge graphs can be integrated into various stages of a RAG pipeline to enhance its functionality. It presents a case for the strategic use of knowledge graphs to inject human reasoning into RAG systems and discusses the potential for knowledge graphs to play a significant role in personalization and the future ontology market. The practical example and the discussion of the advantages of knowledge graphs over vector databases underscore the value of this technology in complex RAG systems. WhyHow.AI is presented as a resource for developers looking to incorporate knowledge graphs into their RAG pipelines.
