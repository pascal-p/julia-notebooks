#### Introduction
The article by Chia Jeng Yang, published in Enterprise RAG on January 5, 2024, delves into the application of knowledge graphs (KG) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The focus is on identifying the types of problems that can be addressed by integrating knowledge graphs at various stages of the RAG process. The author aims to demonstrate how knowledge graphs can be used to enhance the accuracy of answers and queries, and to inject structured human reasoning into RAG systems.
#### Background and Terminology
The article begins with an overview of the terminology related to the steps in a KG-enabled RAG process:
- **Stage 1: Pre-processing**: Processing of a query before chunk extraction from the vector database.
- **Stage 2/D: Chunk Extraction**: Retrieval of the most related chunk(s) of information from the database.
- **Stage 3-5: Post-Processing**: Preparation of the retrieved information to generate the answer.
#### Pre-processing
- **Query Augmentation**: This involves adding context to a query before retrieval, which helps to correct bad queries and inject a company's perspective on certain terms. For instance, a travel-tech company might want to differentiate between 'beachfront' and 'near the beach' homes. Knowledge graphs have also been used to build acronym dictionaries for enterprise search systems. This stage is crucial for multi-hop reasoning.
#### Chunk Extraction
- **Document Hierarchies**: Creation of document hierarchies and rules for navigating chunks within a vector database. This allows for the quick identification of relevant chunks and the use of natural language rules to guide the retrieval process.
- **Contextual Dictionaries**: These are knowledge graphs of metadata that help understand which document chunks contain important topics. They can maintain rules for navigating chunks and ensure consistent extraction of relevant information.
#### Post-processing
- **Recursive Knowledge Graph Queries**: This technique involves combining extracted information and storing it in a knowledge graph to reveal relationships and update answers over time with new context.
- **Answer Augmentation**: Adding context to an initially generated query from the vector database, which is useful for including disclaimers or caveats in answers.
- **Answer Rules**: Enforcing consistent rules about answers that can be generated, which has implications for trust and safety.
- **Chunk Access Controls**: Knowledge graphs can enforce rules regarding which chunks a user can retrieve based on their permissions.
#### Practical Example
The article provides a practical example from the medical field, where a RAG system is used to answer the question, "What is the latest research in Alzheimerâ€™s disease treatment?" The example demonstrates how the RAG system can be enhanced with knowledge graphs through stages 1 to 6, including query augmentation, document hierarchies, recursive knowledge graph queries, chunk control access, augmented response, and chunk personalization.
#### Conclusion and Further Ideas
The author concludes by highlighting the potential for monetization of company/industry ontologies and the concept of personalization through digital twins. Knowledge graphs can serve as digital twins, reflecting a broad collection of user traits for personalization efforts. The article also mentions WhyHow.AI's focus on simplifying knowledge graph creation and management within RAG pipelines.
