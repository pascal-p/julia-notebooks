#### Introduction
The article discusses the concept of hybrid search and its application in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It emphasizes the challenges of achieving production-ready performance in RAG pipelines and introduces hybrid search as a solution to improve the retrieval component's relevance. The author, Leonie Monigatti, explains the combination of keyword-based and vector search algorithms in hybrid search and outlines the trade-offs of each method.
#### Main Concepts
- **Hybrid Search**: A technique that merges keyword-based search with vector search to enhance the relevance of search results.
- **Keyword-based Search**: Utilizes sparse embeddings, often generated by the BM25 algorithm, which is an extension of TF-IDF.
- **Vector Search**: Employs dense vector embeddings, typically produced by modern machine learning algorithms like Transformers, to semantically search across data.
- **Combining Results**: The article describes methods to fuse and rerank search results from both keyword-based and vector searches, using a parameter `alpha` to weight the importance of each algorithm's results.
#### Practical Implementation
- **RAG Pipeline Tuning**: The parameter `alpha` is considered a hyperparameter in RAG pipelines, which can be adjusted to balance keyword-based and semantic search.
- **LangChain Example**: The article provides code snippets demonstrating how to define a retriever component with hybrid search capabilities using LangChain's `WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever`.
#### Code Snippets
The article includes several code snippets, which are presented below with correct indentation:
Sparse Embeddings Example:
```python
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 24, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
```
Dense Vector Embeddings Example:
```python
[0.634, 0.234, 0.867, 0.042, 0.249, 0.093, 0.029, 0.123, 0.234, ...]
```
Hybrid Score Calculation:
```python
hybrid_score = (1 - alpha) * sparse_score + alpha * dense_score
```
LangChain Vector Store Definition:
```python
# Define and populate vector store
# See details here https://towardsdatascience.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2
vectorstore = ...
# Set vectorstore as retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```
LangChain Hybrid Search Retriever Definition:
```python
from langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search import WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever
retriever = WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever(
    alpha = 0.5,               # defaults to 0.5, which is equal weighting between keyword and semantic search
    client = client,           # keyword arguments to pass to the Weaviate client
    index_name = "LangChain",  # The name of the index to use
    text_key = "text",         # The name of the text key to use
    attributes = [],           # The attributes to return in the results
)
```
#### Use Cases and Benefits
The article highlights Stack Overflow's implementation of hybrid search to improve its search capabilities. It illustrates how hybrid search can be beneficial in scenarios where semantic search enhances the user experience, but exact keyword matching is still crucial for specific terms.
#### Conclusion
Hybrid search is presented as a valuable approach for improving the accuracy of search results in RAG pipelines. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of tuning the `alpha` parameter to optimize retrieval performance for different use cases.
