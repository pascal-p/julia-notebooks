## Introduction
The author, Kamelyoussef, shares insights from a project on long text summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs) and K-means clustering. The article addresses the challenge of information overload in the digital age and the necessity for effective summarization techniques. The author promises to provide references and resources used in the project at the end of the article. The project is accessible on GitHub, with links provided for both the general project and the Ollama implementation.
## The Need for Text Summarization
In the context of an information-saturated environment, the author highlights the importance of summarizing extensive documents to make knowledge more accessible. Traditionally, this task has been performed by human editors, a subjective and labor-intensive process. The emergence of LLMs like GPT-3 has revolutionized text summarization by offering the ability to generate accurate and coherent summaries.
## Methodology
The article outlines the use of LLMs in conjunction with clustering techniques, specifically K-means, to enhance summarization performance. The author assumes the reader has a Python environment set up and introduces PyMuPDF for extracting text from PDFs. The text extraction process is described, including the potential for additional cleaning and analysis of PDF blocks.
### PyMuPDF Utilization
An example of using PyMuPDF functions is mentioned, with a detailed example provided in an external article. The author discusses the potential for cleaning the text further with additional functions.
### Introduction to LangChain
LangChain, an open-source framework for developing LLM-powered applications, is introduced. It allows developers to combine LLMs with other components and provides a unified interface for various tooling frameworks.
### Embedding and Clustering
The author explains the concept of embedding as a vector representation of text, which can be used to compare the meanings of different text chunks. Two methods for embedding are introduced: OpenAI Embedding API and Huggingface. The necessity of obtaining API keys for both is mentioned, along with the process of storing and loading these keys using a .env file and the dotenv library. The pricing for the OpenAI API is referenced, and a free alternative using HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings is suggested, with a note on its time-consuming nature and the benefit of running it on a GPU.
### Clustering with K-means
The author describes the process of clustering embeddings using the K-means algorithm, selecting a representative group of chunks to summarize a long text. The concept of prompt engineering in GPT is explained as a means to guide the model's output.
### Summarization Process
The summarization process involves using gpt-3.5-turbo to summarize individual chunks and then combining these summaries with the help of gpt-4 to create a final summary. The author notes the use of gpt-4 due to its larger token limit, which helps reduce information loss.
### Project Implementation
The author mentions adding a frontend layer using Streamlit and outlines the deployment process in three simple steps.
