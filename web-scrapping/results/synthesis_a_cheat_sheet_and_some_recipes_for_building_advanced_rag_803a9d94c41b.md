## Introduction
The article serves as a guide for individuals interested in developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, providing a framework for understanding and applying advanced techniques to build sophisticated RAG systems. It references a RAG survey paper by Gao, Yunfan, et al. (2023) titled "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey" which can be found at [arXiv:2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997.pdf).
## RAG System Fundamentals
RAG systems are defined by their ability to retrieve documents from an external knowledge database and use them alongside a user's query to generate responses through a Large Language Model (LLM). The article outlines two high-level success requirements for RAG systems:
1. Accurate and relevant retrieval of documents.
2. Generation of useful and relevant answers to user questions.
Advanced RAG systems employ sophisticated techniques to meet these requirements, either by addressing them independently or simultaneously.
## Advanced Techniques for RAG Systems
### Retrieval Component Enhancement
#### LlamaIndex Chunk Size Optimization Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: This technique involves optimizing the chunk size of documents for retrieval, which can be crucial for the system's performance.
#### LlamaIndex Recursive Retrieval Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: This method allows for recursive retrievals or routed retrieval in complex scenarios, where the external knowledge requires more structure.
### Generation Component Enhancement
#### LlamaIndex Information Compression Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: This technique focuses on compressing the information from retrieved documents to align them better with the LLM for generation.
#### LlamaIndex Re-Ranking For Better Generation Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: Re-ranking retrieved documents is beneficial to counteract the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon in LLMs, where they focus on the extreme ends of prompts.
### Synergistic Techniques for Retrieval and Generation
#### LlamaIndex Generator-Enhanced Retrieval Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: This method enhances retrieval by using the generator's capabilities to improve the relevance of retrieved documents.
#### LlamaIndex Iterative Retrieval-Generator Recipe
- **Notebook Guide**: A guide is mentioned but not linked.
- **Description**: For complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning, this technique uses an iterative approach to retrieval and generation.
## Evaluation of RAG Systems
The article emphasizes the importance of evaluating RAG systems and references the seven measurement aspects indicated by Gao, Yunfan, et al. in their survey paper. The llama-index library provides several evaluation abstractions and integrations to RAGAs for this purpose. A few evaluation notebook guides are mentioned but not linked.
## Practical Implementation Examples
The article includes Python code snippets demonstrating how to implement various components of a RAG system using the llama_index library. These examples cover the loading of data, building of indexes, tuning of parameters, and the construction of query engines with advanced features such as recursive retrieval and post-processing.
### Example Snippets
#### Basic RAG System Setup
```python
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex
# load data
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir="...").load_data()
# build VectorStoreIndex for document chunking and encoding
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents=documents)
# The QueryEngine class facilitates retrieval and generation
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
# Use your Default RAG
response = query_engine.query("A user's query")
```
#### Hyperparameter Tuning for RAG
```python
from llama_index import ServiceContext
from llama_index.param_tuner.base import ParamTuner, RunResult
from llama_index.evaluation import SemanticSimilarityEvaluator, BatchEvalRunner
# Recipe for hyperparameter tuning via grid-search
# Define objective function, build ParamTuner, and execute tuning
# Objective function example
def objective_function(params_dict):
    # ... (code for building RAG pipeline and evaluating responses)
    return RunResult(score=mean_score, params=params_dict)
# Build ParamTuner object with search parameters
param_tuner = ParamTuner(
    # ... (code for setting up ParamTuner)
)
# Execute hyperparameter search
results = param_tuner.tune()
best_result = results.best_run_result
```
#### Recursive Retrieval
```python
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
from llama_index.schema import IndexNode
# Recipe for building a recursive retriever
# Load data, build parent chunks, define smaller child chunks
# Define VectorStoreIndex with all nodes and build RecursiveRetriever
# Perform inference with advanced RAG
# ... (code for setting up and using a recursive retriever)
```
#### Information Compression and Re-Ranking
```python
# Recipes for defining postprocessors and building QueryEngines
# that use these postprocessors on retrieved documents
# ... (code for setting up and using postprocessors like LongLLMLinguaPostprocessor and CohereRerank)
```
#### Generator-Enhanced Retrieval and Iterative Retrieval-Generator
```python
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI
from llama_index.query_engine import FLAREInstructQueryEngine
# Recipe for building a FLAREInstructQueryEngine
# and a RetryQueryEngine for iterative retrieval-generation cycles
# ... (code for setting up and using these advanced query engines)
```
