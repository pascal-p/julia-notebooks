#### Introduction
The article is the second installment in the Advanced RAG learning series, focusing on the optimization of the retrieval process in recommendation systems. It introduces the concept of dynamic retrieval, which is a two-stage process that initially employs embedding-based retrieval followed by a re-ranking step powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The author, Akash Mathur, emphasizes the importance of re-ranking in enhancing the precision of search results while maintaining a large top-k for recall.
#### Embedding-based Retrieval and Its Limitations
Embedding-based retrieval is praised for its speed, scalability, and ability to handle large datasets. However, it can sometimes return irrelevant results, which affects the quality of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. To address this, a two-stage retrieval process is proposed, where the first stage focuses on recall, and the second stage uses an LLM to re-rank the results, improving precision.
#### Implementation of Re-ranking with LlamaIndex
The author outlines the implementation of re-ranking using the open-source LLM `zephyr-7b-alpha` and the embedding model `hkunlp/instructor-large`. The process involves creating nodes from text chunks, configuring the index and retriever, and initializing re-rankers.
#### Re-ranker Models and Evaluation
Three re-ranker models are compared:
1. CohereRerank
2. bge-reranker-base
3. bge-reranker-large
The evaluation of these re-rankers is conducted using the `RetrieverEvaluator` class, which assesses the quality of retrieved results against ground-truth context. Metrics such as hit-rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) are used. The author also mentions the possibility of generating synthetic datasets for evaluation using LlamaIndex's `generate_question_context_pairs` function.
#### Code Snippets
The article includes Python code snippets that demonstrate the setup and evaluation process. The code is structured to load documents, parse nodes, configure the LLM and embedding models, set up the service context, create the index, configure the retriever, and define the re-rankers. Helper functions are provided to retrieve nodes, visualize results, and display evaluation metrics.
```python
# Imports and configurations are assumed but not explicitly provided in the excerpt.
# The following code snippets are based on the provided excerpt.
# Initialization of LLM and embedding models
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(
    model_name="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha",
    tokenizer_name="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha",
    # Additional configuration omitted for brevity
)
embed_model = HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings(
    model_name="hkunlp/instructor-large", 
    # Additional configuration omitted for brevity
)
# ServiceContext setup
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm, embed_model=embed_model)
# Index configuration
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, service_context=service_context)
# Retriever configuration
retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(
    index=vector_index,
    similarity_top_k=10,
    service_context=service_context
)
# Define re-rankers
RERANKERS = {
    "WithoutReranker": "None",
    "CohereRerank": CohereRerank(api_key=cohere_api_key, top_n=5),
    "bge-reranker-base": SentenceTransformerRerank(model="BAAI/bge-reranker-base", top_n=5),
    "bge-reranker-large": SentenceTransformerRerank(model="BAAI/bge-reranker-large", top_n=5)
}
# Helper functions and evaluation logic omitted for brevity
```
#### Conclusion and Further Research
The results from the evaluation highlight the significance of re-rankers in optimizing retrieval. The author suggests that the choice of embedding for the initial search is crucial, as even the best re-ranker cannot compensate for poor initial retrieval. The article concludes by encouraging further experimentation to find the optimal combination of embeddings and re-rankers.
