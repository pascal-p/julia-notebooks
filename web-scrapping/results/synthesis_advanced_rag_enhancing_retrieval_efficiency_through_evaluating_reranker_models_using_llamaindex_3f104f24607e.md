#### Introduction
The article is the second installment in the Advanced RAG learning series, focusing on optimizing the retrieval process in recommendation systems using LlamaIndex. It introduces the concept of dynamic retrieval, which is crucial for pruning irrelevant context and enhancing precision while maintaining a large top-k value. The author, Akash Mathur, emphasizes the importance of re-ranking in the retrieval process, which refines the initially retrieved results to improve relevance and accuracy.
#### Retrieval and Re-ranking Process
The retrieval process begins with embedding-based retrieval, which is quick but may lack precision. To address this, a two-stage process is employed:
1. The first stage involves embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value, prioritizing recall.
2. The second stage uses a more computationally intensive process to rerank the initially retrieved candidates, focusing on precision.
The re-ranking process is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), which assesses the relevance of documents to a query. The LLM used in this experiment is `zephyr-7b-alpha`, and the embedding model is `hkunlp/instructor-large`. The embedding model ranks at #14 on the MTEB leaderboard and is capable of generating text embeddings tailored to any task without finetuning.
#### Experiment Setup
The experiment involves the following steps:
1. **Chunking:** Text is split into chunks of 512 to create nodes, which are the atomic units of data in LlamaIndex.
2. **LLM and Embedding:** The `zephyr-7b-alpha` LLM and `hkunlp/instructor-large` embedding are used. The LLM is quantified for memory and computation to run on a T4 GPU in the free tier on Colab.
3. **Configure Index and Retriever:** A `ServiceContext` object is set up to construct an index and query. A `VectorStoreIndex` is used for embedding documents and retrieving the top-k most similar nodes.
4. **Initialize Re-rankers:** Three rerankers are compared for performance: `CohereRerank`, `bge-reranker-base`, and `bge-reranker-large`.
5. **Retrieval Comparisons:** The retrieval strategy is key to relevancy and efficiency. Node postprocessors are applied after node retrieval and before response synthesis.
#### Evaluation of Retrieval and Re-ranking
The `RetrieverEvaluator` is used to evaluate the quality of the retriever with metrics such as hit-rate and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank). A synthetic dataset is generated using the `generate_question_context_pairs` function, which auto-generates questions from each context chunk using the LLM.
#### Results and Conclusion
The results highlight the significance of rerankers in optimizing the retrieval process, with `CohereRerank` showing notable performance. The experiment demonstrates that selecting the appropriate embedding for the initial search is crucial, and the combination of embeddings and rerankers is an active research area.
#### Code Snippets
The article includes Python code snippets for setting up the experiment, which are rendered verbatim below:
```python
from google.colab import userdata
# huggingface and cohere api token
hf_token = userdata.get('hf_token')
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
)
# ... (Code continues with the setup of LLM, embedding, ServiceContext, index, and retriever)
# Define all embeddings and rerankers
RERANKERS = {
    "WithoutReranker": "None",
    "CohereRerank": CohereRerank(api_key=cohere_api_key, top_n=5),
    "bge-reranker-base": SentenceTransformerRerank(model="BAAI/bge-reranker-base", top_n=5),
    "bge-reranker-large": SentenceTransformerRerank(model="BAAI/bge-reranker-large", top_n=5)
}
# ... (Code continues with helper functions, visualization, and evaluation setup)
```
