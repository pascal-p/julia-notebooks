#### Introduction
The article is the second installment in the Advanced RAG learning series, focusing on optimizing the retrieval process in recommendation systems using LlamaIndex. The author, Akash Mathur, discusses the concept of dynamic retrieval, which is crucial for pruning irrelevant context and enhancing precision in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The article emphasizes the importance of re-ranking in the retrieval process, which involves sorting, refining, or reordering initially retrieved results to improve relevance or accuracy.
#### Retrieval and Re-ranking Process
The retrieval process begins with embedding-based retrieval, which is fast but may lack precision. To address this, a two-stage process is employed:
1. The first stage involves embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value, prioritizing recall over precision.
2. The second stage uses a more computationally intensive process to rerank the initially retrieved candidates, focusing on higher precision and lower recall.
The re-ranking process is exemplified by searching for information about penguins, where initially retrieved articles about "Penguins in Antarctica" are refined to prioritize articles about "Penguins in Zoo Habitats" based on the user's intent.
#### Experiment Implementation
The article outlines a step-by-step implementation of the retrieval and re-ranking process using the following components:
- **Open Source LLM**: `zephyr-7b-alpha`
- **Embedding**: `hkunlp/instructor-large`
##### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Chunking**: The text is split into chunks of size 512 to create nodes, which are the atomic units of data in LlamaIndex.
2. **Open Source LLM and Embedding**: The `zephyr-7b-alpha` LLM is used along with the `hkunlp/instructor-large` embedding model, which is capable of generating text embeddings tailored to any task without finetuning.
3. **Configure Index and Retriever**: The `ServiceContext` object is set up to construct an index and query. The `VectorStoreIndex` embeds documents and creates vector embeddings of every node, which can be queried by an LLM.
4. **Top K Retrieval**: The `VectorStoreIndex` returns the most similar embeddings as their corresponding chunks of text, controlled by the `top_k` parameter.
5. **Initialize Re-rankers**: The performance of the retrieval is compared with three rerankers.
6. **Retrieval Comparisons**: The retriever's efficiency is evaluated using `RetrieverEvaluator` with metrics like hit-rate and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank).
#### Re-rankers and Their Performance
The article compares the performance of three rerankers:
- `CohereRerank`
- `bge-reranker-base`
- `bge-reranker-large`
The rerankers are evaluated based on their ability to improve retrieval performance metrics. The `CohereRerank` is highlighted for its ability to enhance the performance of any embedding.
#### Code Snippets
The article includes Python code snippets that demonstrate the implementation of the retrieval and re-ranking process. The code includes the setup of the LLM, embedding model, service context, index, and retriever, as well as the initialization of rerankers and evaluation functions.
#### Conclusion
The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate embedding for the initial search and the combination of embeddings and rerankers. The author provides links to the complete code on GitHub and other resources for further exploration of advanced RAG methods.
