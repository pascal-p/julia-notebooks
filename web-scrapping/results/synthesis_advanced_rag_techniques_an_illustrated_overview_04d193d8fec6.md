## Introduction
The article provides a comprehensive study of advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and algorithms, aiming to systematize various approaches. The author, Ivan Ilin, does not delve into code implementation details but references a collection of links to documentation and tutorials for further exploration. The article's purpose is to facilitate developers' understanding of RAG technology by summarizing key advanced RAG techniques, primarily focusing on implementations in the LlamaIndex library.
## RAG Concept Overview
RAG combines search algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate answers grounded in retrieved information. It has become a popular architecture for LLM-based systems in 2023, with applications ranging from QA services to chat-with-your-data apps. The article mentions vector search engines like faiss, chroma, weavaite.io, and pinecone, which have been enhanced by the RAG hype. Open source libraries such as LangChain and LlamaIndex have seen massive adoption for building LLM-based pipelines and applications.
## Naive RAG
The naive RAG pipeline starts with a corpus of text documents. The process involves chunking texts, embedding them into vectors using a Transformer Encoder model, indexing these vectors, and creating prompts for an LLM. The runtime process includes vectorizing the user's query, executing a search against the index, retrieving top-k results, and using them as context in the LLM prompt. Prompt engineering is highlighted as a cost-effective way to improve RAG pipelines, with a reference to OpenAI's prompt engineering guide.
## Advanced RAG Techniques
The article dives into advanced RAG techniques, outlining core steps and algorithms. It discusses chunking and vectorization, search index optimization, context enrichment, fusion retrieval, reranking and filtering, query transformations, agents in RAG, and response synthesis. Each technique is explained in detail, with references to implementations and tutorials, mostly within the LlamaIndex library.
### 1. Chunking & Vectorization
Chunking involves splitting documents into meaningful chunks to better represent their semantic meaning. The chunk size is a critical parameter, balancing context for LLM reasoning against specific text embedding for efficient search. Vectorization involves selecting a model to embed chunks, with search-optimized models like bge-large or E5 embeddings recommended.
### 2. Search Index
The search index is a crucial part of the RAG pipeline, storing vectorized content. The article discusses flat indices, vector indices like faiss, nmslib, or annoy, and managed solutions like Pinecone and Weaviate. Hierarchical indices and hypothetical questions are also covered, along with the HyDE approach and context enrichment techniques.
### 3. Reranking & Filtering
Postprocessors in LlamaIndex allow for filtering and reranking retrieval results based on various criteria. This step refines the results before feeding the context to the LLM.
### 4. Query Transformations
Query transformations involve using an LLM to modify user input to improve retrieval quality. Techniques include decomposing complex queries into sub-queries, step-back prompting, and query re-writing.
### 5. Chat Engine
Chat engines manage dialogue context, supporting follow-up questions and user commands. ContextChatEngine and CondensePlusContextMode are two approaches mentioned for context compression.
### 6. Query Routing
Query routing involves decision-making on the next steps given a user query. It can include selecting an index or data store or routing to sub-chains or other agents.
### 7. Agents in RAG
Agents provide an LLM with tools and tasks to complete. The article touches on the concept of agents and their role in RAG, particularly in multi-document retrieval settings.
### 8. Response Synthesizer
The final step in a RAG pipeline is generating an answer based on retrieved context and the initial user query. Various approaches to response synthesis are discussed, including iterative refinement, summarization, and generating multiple answers.
## Encoder and LLM Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning the Transformer Encoder or LLM can improve the quality of context retrieval and answer generation. The article discusses the benefits and potential drawbacks of fine-tuning, referencing a study that showed a modest performance increase.
## Evaluation
Frameworks for evaluating RAG systems' performance are mentioned, focusing on metrics like answer relevance, groundedness, and retrieved context relevance. The article references evaluation frameworks like Ragas, Truelens, and LangSmith.
## Conclusion
The author concludes by emphasizing the excitement around ML advancements in 2023 and the potential for smaller LLMs. The article's main references are collected in a knowledge base, and the author invites readers to connect on LinkedIn or Twitter.
