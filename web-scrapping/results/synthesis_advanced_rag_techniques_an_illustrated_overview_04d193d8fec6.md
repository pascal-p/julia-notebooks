## Introduction
The article provides a comprehensive study of advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and algorithms, systematizing various approaches. The author, Ivan Ilin, published the article on December 17, 2023, in Towards AI. The article aims to overview and explain available RAG algorithms and techniques without delving into implementation details, instead referencing extensive documentation and tutorials.
RAG combines search algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate answers grounded in retrieved information. It has become the most popular architecture for LLM-based systems in 2023, with applications ranging from Question Answering services to chat-with-your-data apps. The article references two prominent open-source libraries for LLM-based pipelines and applications: LangChain and LlamaIndex.
## Main Content
### Naive RAG
The article begins by describing the vanilla RAG case, which involves splitting text into chunks, embedding these chunks into vectors using a Transformer Encoder model, indexing these vectors, and creating prompts for an LLM that include the retrieved context. The author emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, referencing an OpenAI guide, and mentions various LLM providers.
### Advanced RAG
The advanced RAG techniques section introduces a scheme depicting core steps and algorithms involved in RAG, excluding logic loops and complex multistep behaviors for clarity. The author discusses chunking and vectorization, search index optimization, context enrichment, fusion retrieval, reranking and filtering, query transformations, reference citations, chat engines, query routing, agents in RAG, and response synthesizers.
#### 1. Chunking & Vectorization
The author explains the need to chunk data and select a model for embedding chunks, recommending search-optimized models and providing an example of a full data ingestion pipeline in LlamaIndex.
#### 2. Search Index
The section on search indices covers vector store indices, hierarchical indices, hypothetical questions and HyDE, and context enrichment techniques like Sentence Window Retrieval and Auto-merging Retriever.
#### 3. Reranking & Filtering
The author describes postprocessors in LlamaIndex that filter and rerank retrieval results based on various criteria.
#### 4. Query Transformations
Query transformations involve using an LLM to modify user input to improve retrieval quality. The author discusses sub-queries, step-back prompting, and query re-writing.
#### 5. Chat Engine
Chat engines manage dialogue context for follow-up questions and user commands. The author describes different approaches to context compression and chat engines.
#### 6. Query Routing
Query routing involves decision-making on what to do next with a user query, including selecting an index or data store.
#### 7. Agents in RAG
Agents are LLMs with a set of tools and tasks to complete. The author briefly touches on OpenAI Assistants and their function calling API, and describes a multi-document agent scheme.
#### 8. Response Synthesizer
The final step in a RAG pipeline is generating an answer based on retrieved context and the initial user query. The author outlines different approaches to response synthesis.
### Encoder and LLM Fine-Tuning
The author discusses fine-tuning the Transformer Encoder and LLMs, cautioning against narrowing the model's capabilities and providing examples of fine-tuning for improved performance.
### Evaluation
Several frameworks for RAG system performance evaluation are mentioned, focusing on metrics such as answer relevance, groundedness, and retrieved context relevance. The author references evaluation tools and frameworks like Ragas, Truelens, and LangSmith.
## Conclusion
Ivan Ilin concludes by summarizing the core algorithmic approaches to RAG and expressing excitement for the advancements in ML in 2023. He anticipates a bright future for smaller LLMs and highlights the main production challenge for RAG systems: speed.
