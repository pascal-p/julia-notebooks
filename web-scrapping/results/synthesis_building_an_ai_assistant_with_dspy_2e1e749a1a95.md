### Title: Building an AI Assistant with DSPy
#### Introduction
The article "Building an AI Assistant with DSPy," published on March 7, 2024, discusses the challenges of prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces DSPy, a high-level programming framework designed to simplify the development of AI assistants by automating the process of writing and tuning prompts for LLMs. The author expresses frustration with the current state of LLM-based application development, which often involves cumbersome prompt engineering, and proposes DSPy as a solution that allows developers to focus on building agent pipelines programmatically without directly dealing with prompts.
#### Main Content
##### Disadvantages of Prompt Engineering
The author begins by highlighting the limitations and frustrations associated with prompt engineering, including its brittleness and the unappealing necessity to coax desired responses from LLMs through flattery or bribery. This sets the stage for the introduction of DSPy as a tool that abstracts away the complexities of prompt engineering, allowing developers to leverage LLMs more effectively and efficiently.
##### Concept of an AI Assistant
An AI assistant is defined as a computer program that aids humans in completing tasks by streamlining workflows through information retrieval, document analysis, form filling, function calling, and error identification. The author chooses the card game bridge as a use case to demonstrate the development of an AI assistant with DSPy, emphasizing that the principles applied can be generalized to other domains.
##### Agent Framework
The article describes an agent framework where backend services are invoked via agents built using LLMs. This framework allows for decoupling and specialization, with agents capable of reasoning, searching, and performing non-textual work, while a fluent and coherent LLM fronts the entire framework, handling intents and routing them appropriately.
##### Zero Shot Prompting with DSPy
The author introduces DSPy's approach to zero-shot prompting, showcasing how to build a simple module that queries an LLM for information about the game of bridge. This section includes a Python code snippet demonstrating the creation of a `ZeroShot` class that inherits from `dspy.Module` and uses `dspy.Predict` to send a prompt to an LLM and receive a response. The process is described as LLM-agnostic, emphasizing DSPy's flexibility in working with different LLMs.
```python
class ZeroShot(dspy.Module):
  """
  Provide answer to question
  """
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.prog = dspy.Predict("question -> answer")
  def forward(self, question):
    return self.prog(question="In the game of bridge, " + question)
```
The article further illustrates how to configure DSPy with an LLM and invoke the `ZeroShot` module to get a response to a query about Stayman, a bridge bidding convention.
##### Text Extraction
DSPy's capabilities extend beyond simple LLM calls to include entity extraction. The author presents another Python code snippet for a module that extracts bridge-related terms from a question. This example highlights DSPy's ability to represent module signatures as Python classes and its concise, readable syntax.
```python
class Terms(dspy.Signature):
  """
  List of extracted entities
  """
  prompt = dspy.InputField()
  terms = dspy.OutputField(format=list)
class FindTerms(dspy.Module):
  """
  Extract bridge terms from a question
  """
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.entity_extractor = dspy.Predict(Terms)
  def forward(self, question):
    max_num_terms = max(1, len(question.split())//4)
    instruction = f"Identify up to {max_num_terms} terms in the following question that are jargon in the card game bridge."
    prediction = self.entity_extractor(
      prompt=f"{instruction}\n{question}"
    )
    return prediction.terms
```
##### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Orchestration
The article briefly mentions DSPy's built-in support for various retrievers, including ChromaDB, and the orchestration of agent modules within a DSPy-based AI assistant. The orchestration process involves invoking agent modules in a specific sequence to fulfill user queries or tasks.
##### Optimizer
DSPy's optimizer feature is introduced, which allows for the automatic tuning of prompts based on example data. This feature is exemplified through the use of a `teleprompt.LabeledFewShot` class that compiles an optimized version of an orchestrator module using training data. The author compares the outputs of the original and optimized pipelines, demonstrating the effectiveness of DSPy's optimization in improving response accuracy.
#### Conclusion
The article concludes with an endorsement of DSPy as a powerful tool for developing AI assistants without the need for manual prompt engineering. The author's examples, ranging from simple query responses to complex orchestration and optimization of agent modules, illustrate DSPy's versatility and potential to streamline the development of LLM-based applications. The article encourages further exploration of DSPy and its applications in various domains.
